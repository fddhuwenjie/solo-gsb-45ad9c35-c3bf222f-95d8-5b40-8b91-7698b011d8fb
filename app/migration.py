"""Cross-pool allocation migration: move in-use subnets between pools.

``POST /pools/{id}/allocation-migrations`` moves a caller-supplied manifest
of existing allocations (identified by ``request_id``) from a source pool to
a target pool while preserving every allocation's CIDR, ``request_id``,
prefix length, row id and ``created_at`` -- only the owning ``pool_id``
changes.

The whole operation runs inside one ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` write transaction
that pins both pool states.  It is accepted only when every check below
passes:

* the manifest contains no duplicate ``request_id``;
* every manifest entry identifies an allocation that currently belongs to
  the source pool;
* every allocation CIDR is completely contained in the target pool;
* no moved CIDR overlaps a target-pool exclusion range or any other
  allocation already living in the target pool;
* neither the source nor the target pool has a ``planned`` or ``active``
  BGP announcement plan, so a pinned plan summary can never drift away from
  the pool state it describes.

Any failure rolls the transaction back: neither pool is touched.  On
success the allocations are re-homed and the input-order mapping is
returned.

``operation_id`` is the idempotency key: retrying with the same source and
target pools and the same manifest (input order is significant) replays the
original result even after the allocations have already been moved; the
same key with different parameters is a 409 conflict.
